            In the depths of Discord, where Aarons abound,<br>
            Each seeking free games, their wallets compound<br>
            "Yo, where's that girl dev?" they eagerly chase,<br>
            Their NFT avatars flooding cyberspace<br><br>
            
            One Aaron had Pepe, another had Punk,<br>
            Their tokenized hopes gradually sunk<br>
            "Wen airdrop?" they cry in channels galore,<br>
            While their crypto bags keep dropping more<br><br>
            
            The girl dev just laughed as she built something real,<br>
            While Aarons kept searching for that perfect deal<br>
            Their Web3 dreams of riches untold,<br>
            Turned out to be copium, if truth be told<br><br>
            
            So here's to the Aarons, still searching today,<br>
            For free alpha, airdrops, and games they won't play<br>
            Their wallets are empty, but hope springs eternal,<br>
            In Discord they dwell, in FOMO infernal
