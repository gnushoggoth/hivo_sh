ALL BOUNTIES MUST BE DEPLOYED TO THEIR OWN URLS AND NOT RUN WITHIN AI CONTAINERIZATION (see projects like http://gnon.ai or http://deertick.io or project89.org for examples).

You may use a pre-existing URL and redirect via a sub page to the deployment though. (example http://tee-hee.xyz/funpage would work if you already have a domain).

python deploy_svg.py

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Youâ€™ll see your dramatic Terraform Deployment Visualizer!
